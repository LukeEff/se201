### 1.

LOCs and SLOCs are popular metrics used by the software industry to estimate
cost, developer producivity, maintainability, and other management concerns.
It's a poor way to measure productivity as more lines of code a day does not
mean a programmer was more productive. Clean code can take a lot of time and be
the best for long term maintainability, but isn't necessarily a huge amount of
code. Some algorithms take a lot of time to think of but are only a few lines of
code. Planning takes a lot of time too for complex architectures. Short or long
code does not measure how well the program will even run.

I think this approach is too hard to understand. The code ended up being
squashed into a few lines which makes it hard to decipher and if there was a bug
in it, difficult to fix and modify. I prefer writing in a style that is more
like the previous chapters than ninjacode like this.
