### 1.

I do not like this monolithic style because the lack of abstraction and use of
libraries makes the code very intimidating to look at and seems messy and not
reusable to me. The code is still far easier to read than the other styles and
the code does directly attack the program, as opposed to the stack solution
which involves understanding how the stack works and then how it is being
applied in this situation and the other approach which is its own beast that has
it's own concepts for saving memory.

### 2. 

If if if if if if if if if... it feels like total stream of conciousness code.
And due to this style, a lot of the code starts on the second half of the page.

### 3.

Usually I try to avoid writing code that is in this way, but when making a short
script, I sometimes don't bother with much abstraction. It is definitely the
most similar to my solution of the three presented so far.

### 4.

goto is basically saying to go to a certain statement within a program, skipping
statements between it and the goto.

### 5.

I think there is merit in using a monolithic style when writing small, less
important scripts that will not be examined by large groups of people. When you
start having a script being looked at by a lot of people, or when the scale is
beyond say a simple script to read a file, life will be easier if the style is
ditched.

### 6. 

Cyclomatic complexity is intended to be a metric for measuring program
complexity based on the amount of control flow paths it has. A highly
cyclomatically complex program would be harder to understand, so it would be
indicative as a worse program.
