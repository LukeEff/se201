### 1.
Line one means to execute this file in python if ran from the terminal. This
means you do not need to type python manually before executing this.

### 2.
The author stores data in a file and retrieves data from that file. The author
then uses python's libraries to read and write to the file. 

### 3.
Today, the style and its memory constraint is relevent when dealing directly
with hardware and when optimizing the use of memory.

### 4.
The algorithm to be employed may require more memory than available, so a
different algorithm would need to be employed. Then there might be another
constraint the new algorithm couldn't meet, so another one would replace it
until a working one is designed.

### 5.
We still are responsible for naming our program elements and API components
appropriately and interacting with program elements and API components that may
or may not have been named well. Also, we want to aim to make our
program texts reflect high-level concepts as much as possible--as opposed to low
level concepts that require relying on external documentation to.

### 6.
Data stored in a database is an example of secondary memory. Primary memory is
very fast, but limited in size, whereas secondary memory will be less fast, but
vastly greater. Databases are intended to store huge amounts of data, so it
uses secondary memory to store it. Additionally, secondary memory will not go
away after the program terminates, unlike primary memory, and it would be very
bad if the data in a database went away after a program terminated or a computer
lost power.
